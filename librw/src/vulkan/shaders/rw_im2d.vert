// Immediate-mode 2D: HUD, fonts, menus. The game submits vertices already in
// screen space, as the fixed-function pipeline expected.
//
// They cannot simply be written out as clip coordinates. Doing that puts the
// same NDC position in both eyes, and because the Quest's per-eye frustums are
// asymmetric, one NDC position is a different direction in each eye -- the two
// images pull apart and never converge.
//
// Instead the screen plane is placed in the world in front of the head by
// scene.im2dTransform, and each eye projects it with its own matrix. The
// result is a stable panel at a comfortable distance rather than something the
// eyes cannot fuse.

// x, y screen; z screen depth; w CAMERA Z IN METRES -- Im2DVertex's
// setRecipCameraZ stores the reciprocal of what it is handed, so this field
// always ends up holding the real distance, never its reciprocal.

	// actually belongs: coronas and other world sprites land on their light
	// source instead of floating on the panel in front of the face, and sort
	// against the scene through the depth test.
	//
	// HUD and font vertices come from CSprite2d, whose depth is the near clip
	// plane; clamping to the panel distance leaves those exactly where they
